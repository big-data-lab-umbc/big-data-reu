Abstract: 
The purpose of this research study is to investigate current advances in predicting ice-bed topography using machine-learning approaches. It dives into the many strategies and algorithms used for predicting ice-bed topography, providing a complete evaluation of the most recent approaches. Furthermore, the paper includes case examples that demonstrate the efficacy and promise of machine learning in properly predicting ice-bed topography, hence leading to a better knowledge of glacier dynamics and consequences for climate change and glaciology research.
